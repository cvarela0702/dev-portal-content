`Collection Badges` is a VTEX component that will render an image with the list of collection badges located at the bottom.
This component can be imported and used by any VTEX app.

## Usage

You should follow the usage instruction in the main [README](https://github.com/vtex-apps/store-components/blob/master/README.md#usage).

To import it into your code:

```tsx
import { CollectionBadges } from 'vtex.store-components'
```

You can use it in your code like a React component with the `JSX` tag: `<CollectionBadges>`.

```tsx
<CollectionBadges collectionBadgesText={[ 'foo', 'bar' ]}>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/dev-portal-content/main/docs/vtex-io/Store Framework Apps/deprecated/..." alt="...">
</CollectionBadges>
```
