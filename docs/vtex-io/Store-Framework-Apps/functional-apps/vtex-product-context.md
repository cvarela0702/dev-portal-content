The Product Context app is responsible for providing data regarding a certain product to all of its children blocks.

## Configuration

1. Add the `product-context` app as a dependency in you theme's `manifest.json` file:


```diff
  "dependencies": {
+   "vtex.product-context": "0.x"
  }
```

Now, you can import any of the exported components and hooks from the app. Here's an example of a component that render's the name of the product whose data is stored in the nearest `ProductContext`:

```tsx
// Notice that this is TypeScript, and this code should be in a .tsx file
import React, { FC } from 'react'
import { useProduct } from 'vtex.product-context'

const MyComponent: FC = () => {
  const productContextValue = useProduct()

  return (
    <Fragment>
      {productContextValue?.product?.productName}
    </Fragment>
  )
}

export default MyComponent
```

### Hooks

#### `useProduct`

This is the most useful export from this app. The `useProduct` hook can be used to read the data from the nearest `ProductContext` relative to its caller. 

The `productContextValue` variable from the example above has the following type definition:

```ts
interface ProductContextState {
  selectedItem?: Item | null
  product: MaybeProduct
  selectedQuantity: number
  skuSelector: {
    selectedImageVariationSKU: string | null
    isVisible: boolean
    areAllVariationsSelected: boolean
  }
  buyButton: BuyButtonContextState
  assemblyOptions: {
    items: Record<GroupId, AssemblyOptionItem[]>
    inputValues: Record<GroupId, InputValues>
    areGroupsValid: Record<GroupId, boolean>
  }
}
```

You should expect an object that looks like that as the return value of `useProduct`. Be aware that, if the hook is called **outside** of a `ProductContextProvider`, the return value could be `undefined` or an empty object.

#### `useProductDispatch`

This hooks returns a `dispatch` function which you can use to manipulate the nearest `ProductContext`. 

The function is capable of performing the following `actions`:

- `SELECT_IMAGE_VARIATION`: Sets the value for the `skuSelector.selectedImageVariationSKU` property.
- `SET_QUANTITY`: Sets the value for the `selectedQuantity` property.
- `SKU_SELECTOR_SET_VARIATIONS_SELECTED`: Sets the value for the `skuSelector.areAllVariationsSelected` property.
- `SET_BUY_BUTTON_CLICKED`: Sets the value for the `buyButton.clicked` property.
- `SKU_SELECTOR_SET_IS_VISIBLE`: Sets the value for the `skuSelector.isVisible` property.
- `SET_SELECTED_ITEM`: Sets the value for the `selectedItem` property.
- `SET_ASSEMBLY_OPTIONS`: Sets the value for the `assemblyOptions` property.
- `SET_PRODUCT`: Sets the value for the `product` property.
- `SET_LOADING_ITEM`: Sets the value if a selected item is loading or not.
