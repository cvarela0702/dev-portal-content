The Checkout UI Settings app allows you to customize your store's through the terminal and the [VTEX IO Toolbelt](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-vtex-io-cli-install).

The main advantage of using the app instead of the [store's admin](https://help.vtex.com/tutorial/configure-template-in-smartcheckout-update--ToTE5XB39t0SwtHgpgwSv?locale=en) for this customization is that your Checkout scripts will behave as configurations for platform apps.

In practice, it means that Checkout UI Settings allows A/B testing in your store's scripts, in addition to the possibility of quick rollbacks for old scripts (i.e. scripts pertaining to older Checkout UI Settings app's versions).

## Configuration

1.  Using your terminal and the [VTEX IO Toolbelt](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-vtex-io-cli-install), log into the desired account;
2.  Run `vtex list` to access the list of apps that are already installed on the account you're working on. If the Checkout UI Settings option already exists, you can skip to step 7 of this step-by-step;
3.  If the Checkout UI Settings app was not found in the list of installed apps, run the `vtex init` command;
4. Select the `checkout-ui-settings` option;
5.  Open the `checkout-ui-settings`  app in whichever code editor you prefer;
6.  In the  `manifest.json`  file, change the predefined default value  `vendor`  to the name of the account in which you want to install the app;
7.  In the  `checkout-ui-custom`  folder, create the files in which the scripts will be included, just as you would do in the [admin's interface](https://help.vtex.com/tutorial/configure-template-in-smartcheckout-update--ToTE5XB39t0SwtHgpgwSv?locale=en#configure-code). Notice that a few defaults files already exist in the `checkout-ui-custom` folder, files which you can use to insert the scripts;
8.  According to the Checkout customization you are looking for, open the most suitable file and insert the desired scripts;
9.  Save your changes. Then, [publish](https://vtex.io/docs/recipes/development/publishing-an-app) the app's new version;
10. Still logged into the desired account, [create a production workspace](https://vtex.io/docs/recipes/development/creating-a-production-workspace) and [install the app](https://vtex.io/docs/recipes/development/installing-an-app);
10. If everything is working as expected, [promote the workspace to master](https://vtex.io/docs/recipes/development/promoting-a-workspace-to-master).

## Modus Operandi 

Once the app is deployed and installed in the account, every scripts contained in it will be automatically linked to your store and used to [build the templates](https://help.vtex.com/tutorial/configure-template-in-smartcheckout-update--ToTE5XB39t0SwtHgpgwSv?locale=en#configuring-templates-from-the-code-menu) to customize your Checkout.
