The Yotpo Reviews Integration app is a product review and rating integration with [Yotpo](https://www.yotpo.com/).

## Configuration

1. [Install](https://vtex.io/docs/recipes/store/installing-an-app) the `yotpo` app in the desired account;
2. In the admin's account, access **Apps** and then select the **Yotpo Integration** box;

![setup-yotpo](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/vtexdocs/dev-portal-content@main/images/vtex-yotpo-1.png)

3. Once in the app's page, define the app’s configurations in the **setup** section:

![setup-yotpo](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/vtexdocs/dev-portal-content@main/images/vtex-yotpo-2.png)

- **Yotpo App Key**: Enter the app key that you have received from Yotpo's admin interface.
- **Use Reference Id**: Check this box if you wish to use the product's reference id rather than its product id to link the product to its reviews.

> ⚠️ This app fills the standard VTEX review blocks with content using abstract interfaces from `vtex.product-review-interfaces` . 

The **VTEX review blocks** are:

- `"product-reviews"`: This block can be added to the product page (`store.product`). It renders the main Yotpo widget which lists any reviews or answered questions for the product being viewed as well as a form to add a new review or ask a new question.

- `"product-rating-summary"`: This block can be added to the product page (`store.product`) and renders the average rating for the product being viewed as well as the number of reviews that have been submitted.

- `"product-rating-inline"`: Similar to the previous block, but intended to be used in product shelves.

Additional **Yotpo review blocks** are:

- `"yotpo-all-reviews"`: This block can be added to a custom page (`store.custom`). It allows you to display all your site and product reviews in one page by rendering a [Yotpo widget](https://support.yotpo.com/en/article/generic-other-platforms-adding-yotpo-reviews-to-a-dedicated-page).

This app also includes a pixel integration to send order conversation tracking data to Yotpo.
