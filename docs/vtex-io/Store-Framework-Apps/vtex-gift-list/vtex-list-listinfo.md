The list information is made up of three blocks `list-info.name` , `list-info.event-date` and `list-info.owner` and each one represents a type of information associated with the list, which are the name of the list, date of the event and name of the owner of the list respectively.

## Configuration

1. Import the `vtex.list` app to your theme's peer dependencies in the `manifest.json` file as in the following example:

```json
  "peerDependencies": {
    "vtex.list": "3.x"
  }
```

2. Add any `list-info` block to other theme block using a list context, such as the `store.guest`. For example:

```diff
  "store.guest": {
    "blocks":[
      "flex-layout.row#breadcrumbs-guest",
      "responsive-layout.desktop#guest",
      "responsive-layout.mobile#guest",
      "flex-layout.col"
    ]
  }

  "flex-layout.col": {
    "children": [
+     "list-info.name",
    ]
  }
```
