The `auth-condition` performs validation that the user is logged in to render different layouts.

## Configuration

1. Import the `vtex.list` app to your theme's peer dependencies in the `manifest.json` file as in the following example:

```json
  "peerDependencies": {
    "vtex.list": "3.x"
  }
```

2. Add the `auth-condition` block for conditional validation in a template, like the one from home. For example:

```diff
   "store.home": {
    "blocks": [
+     "auth-condition",
    ]
  }
```

3. Add the rendering condition you want by passing the blocks via props. For example:

```diff
"auth-condition": {
    "props": {
      "Then": "flex-layout.row#home-with-user",
      "Else": "flex-layout.row#home-without-user"
    }
  }
```
