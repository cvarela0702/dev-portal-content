The Order Quote app provides B2B capabilities to save a shopping cart, storing its items, product quantities and prices for further use.

>⚠️ The Order Quote app is not compatible with the [B2B Suite](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-b2b-suite) solution. Therefore, these instructions do not apply to stores using the B2B Suite. If you are using the B2B Suite, refer to the [B2B Quotes & Carts](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-b2b-quotes) documentation instead.

The user can also print the quotation information containing the cart information along with expiration date which is defined at **Admin > Apps**.

## Configuration

1. Using [VTEX IO CLI](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-vtex-io-cli-installation-and-command-reference), install the Order Quote app by running `vtex install vtex.orderquote@1.x`.
2. Head over to your VTEX account's admin and access the **Apps** section.
3. Select the **Order Quote** app and click on **Settings**.
4. Fill out the **Lifespan** and **Store logo URL** fields.
5. Click on **Save**.
6. Add the Order Quote app as a `peerDependency` in your `store-theme`'s `manifest.json` file:

```diff
 "peerDependencies": {
+  "vtex.orderquote": "1.x"
 }
```

Once declared as a [Peer Dependency](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-peerdependencies), the app will generate a few routes under the `/orderquote` path in order to create the Order Quote custom page. Namely, they are:

| Route                  | Description                                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/orderquote`          | Lists all saved cart quotations.                                                              |
| `/orderquote/create`   | Retrieves the current cart information, allowing you to create cart quotations as you desire. |
| `/orderquote/view/:ID` | Details page, displayed when you click on a quote from the listing page (`/orderquote`).      |

The new routes already contain a default template with all blocks automatically exported by the `orderquote` app, meaning that the Order Quote pages are ready to be rendered and no further actions are required from you.

## Customization

In order to apply CSS customizations in this and other blocks, follow the instructions given in the recipe on [Using CSS Handles for store customization](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-using-css-handles-for-store-customization).
